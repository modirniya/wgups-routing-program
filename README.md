# WGUPS Routing Program

## Overview
The WGUPS Routing Program is a Python application designed to optimize package delivery routes for the Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS). The program uses the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm to determine the most efficient routes for delivery trucks and employs a custom hash table implementation for fast access to package data.

## Features
- Efficient package routing using the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm.
- Fast lookup, insertion, and deletion of package data using a custom hash table.
- Real-time tracking of package delivery status.
- Generation of delivery reports with customizable time ranges.
